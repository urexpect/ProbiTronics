ProbiTronics is my first add on for Kerbal Space Program PC game. Mod is more focused on specialized probes, and parts that help you with reusability of rocket stages. I have great ideas and if everything goes well I will continue to improve and add new parts to this add on. It is currently in alpha version so if you find some bugs please contact me.

New 0.22 version is ready for First Contract

0.21 version is more about science. Ball and G-probe now have custom science experiments, also on all parts configurations are changed.

ProbiTronics mod include:
-     **NEW** SP-1 reusable sample probe for bringing samples back to Kerbin.
-     **NEW** LA-2m -Big Leg Adapter give you ability to use stock legs with longer engines.
-     LA-1m Leg Adapter give you ability to use stock legs with longer engines.
-     SM Mk I (service module for Command Pod Mk1)
-     SM Mk I (service module for Command Pod Mk1)
-     RU-3m MK I Ã¢â‚¬â€œ probe, decoupler and parachute compartment in one. Add two Mk16 parachutes in middle attachment points.
-     RB-721 (more than just rover body)
-     RU-1m (probe, decoupler and parachute compartment in one)
-     RU-2m (probe, decoupler and parachute compartment in one)
-     Ball Probe
-     G-Probe
-     ProbiTronics ATV mk I
-     Ball Shield
-     Ball Parachute (just scaled down stock item Mk16-XL Parachute made by HarvesteR )
