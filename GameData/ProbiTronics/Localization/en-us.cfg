		#PT-legAdapter-2500-desc = 2.5m Leg adapter. Your engine is to tall and so your landing legs don't touch the ground. Not anymore.
		#PT-legAdapter-2500-tags = probitronic leg adapter

		#PT-probe-atv-titl = Automated Transport Vehicle (ATV) mkI
		#PT-probe-atv-desc = ATV (Automated Transport Vehicle) is used for transport food, oxygen, fuel(If you have TAC Life Support) and other stuff in to the space. Don't forget to attach some engine, and solar panel. Also after you unload your cargo you can load some CarbonDioxide and deorbit ATV so it can burn in atmosphere.
